# Labels (especially gyrus and sulcus) were merged together before splitting.
# The merged annotation is aparc.a2009s_custom_merged.annot
# G_front_sup was split to roughly lateral and medial labels before merging

# Notes:
#	- Annot files were generated with divide_parcellation.py (method='PCA')
# 	- Target label size included in name.
#	- generated 16/2/2017
#		-> updated color scheme and new mergefile used.
#	- More accurate stats are included in parcellation_summary.pdf
#	- Number of labels in different parcellations (lh/rh):
		. 700mm2: 82/83
		. 800mm2: 70/69
		. 900mm2: 63/63
		. 1000mm2: 59/57
